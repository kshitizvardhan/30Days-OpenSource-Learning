# Getting Started with Open Source:
--> Find an active project.
--> Talk to people who are contributing to open source. Ask people in tech communities you’re a part of, and check out the list of contributors for the technology you’re interested in
--> Reach out to them to learn more about their experiences contributing to the projects they’re a part of.
--> Find a project that has beginner-friendly issues. Projects with "good first issues" or "beginner-friendly" labels are often good for beginners.
--> Read the project documentation. This will help you understand the project's goals, its codebase, and its coding standards. 
--> Always read through the README and CONTRIBUTING guides. Not only can you get a better understanding of the project, but the expectations for how to contribute should be explained and clear.

Engage with the Community. Join the project’s communication channels, like Discord, their discussions, their blog, and introduce yourself.
Be patient. It takes time to learn how to contribute to an open source project. Just keep learning and practicing

# Benefits to Contributing to Open Source:
--> Learn new skills: Open source projects are a great way to learn new programming skills. You can learn from the code of other developers, and you can get feedback on your own code from the community.
--> Make a difference: Open source software is used by millions of people around the world. By contributing to open source projects, you can help make that software.
--> Gain real-work experience: When you contribute to an open source project, you are demonstrating your skills in a number of areas, including:
--> Programming: Writing code that is both functional and readable.
--> Problem-solving: Identifying and solving problems in code.
--> Collaboration: Working with other developers to achieve a common goal.
--> Communication: Communicating your ideas clearly and concisely, whether that’s in writing documentation or discussing the issue you’re working on.

# Learning the Basics of Contributing:
--> Version Control System: Version control systems (VCS) are tools that help developers manage changes to source code and other files in a collaborative development environment. 
--> Code Organization: How the code is structured will impact readability and maintainability.
--> Code Readability: Writing code that’s easy to understand helps in collaboration and reduces the likelihood of bugs. 
    Ways to do that include:
    - Using descriptive variable names
    - Writing clear comments
    - Consistent formatting.
