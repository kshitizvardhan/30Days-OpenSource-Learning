Day1_Learning_Open_Source

# What is Open Source?
--> Open source refers to something people can modify and share, which is publicly accessible.
--> Open Source refers to a type of software or project for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.


# About Open Source Software:
--> Open Source Software (OSS) refers to software whose source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute the code.


# Difference between open source software and other types of software:
--> In open source software, the author make the source code available to others who would like to view, modify, enhance the existing code.
    It promote collaboration and sharing because, they permit other people to make modifications to source code and incorporate those changes into their own projects.

--> Closed-source software, also known as proprietary software, refers to software for which the source code is not made available to the public. 
--> In this model, the software's source code is kept confidential and is not distributed along with the compiled program that users install and run on their computers or devices.


# Remote/Cloud Computing
--> Online word processing, email management, and image editing software are not installed and run on personal computers. 
    Instead, users simply access these programs on remote computers using a web browser or mobile phone application. 
    When this is done, it is called "remote computing." It is also referred to as cloud computing.


# How it works & about liscences
--> Open source code is usually stored in a public repository and shared publicly. OSS usually comes with a distribution license. 
    This license includes terms that define how developers can use, study, modify, and most importantly, distribute the software. 
    Five of the most popular licenses are :-

    1) MIT License
    2) GNU General Public License (GPL) 2.0—this is more restrictive and requires that copies of modified code are made available for public use
    3) Apache License 2.0
    4) GNU General Public License (GPL) 3.0
    5) BSD License 2.0 (3-clause, New or Revised)—this is less restrictiveiv

--> When source code is changed, OSS must include what was altered as well as the methods involved. 
    Depending on the license terms, the software resulting from these modifications may or may not be required to be made available for free.
