## Version Control
- The term Version control refers to a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time called the ‘versions’. 
- In other words, these versions will help you in tracking the changes in your codes/project and if necessary, undo those changes as well. 
- This feature of being able to compare, differentiate and revert changes between two versions of a particular project becomes really helpful when working on a larger project.

## Version Control System (VCS)
- This system which controls the versioning of the codes is called a Version Control System (VCS).
- VCS takes snapshots of your entire project and stores them as versions. 
- Now with the help of these snapshots, you can easily compare the versions and switch between them as per the need.
- VCS helps in keeping the history of changes as other people save new versions of your code. This history can be reviewed to find out by whom, why, and when changes were done.

So now let’s proceed ahead what exactly is Git.

## What Is Git?
- Git is a version control software which you need to install on your local system in order to use it. 
- Git also is known as distributed version control system which means using Git you can push and pull yours as well as others changes to other people’s machines:
- Now, using Git you can work on the same copy as your team member. 
- But the copy on which you will be working, won’t reflect any of the changes in the main directory unless and until you pull your collaborator’s changes and push back your own changes.

- In today’s market, Git is the most widely and popularly used modern VCS. It is quite matured and is a well maintained open source project.
- It was developed back in 2005, by Linus Torvalds who is also the creator of Linux OS kernel.

## What Is GitHub?
- As told, Git is a version control system which tracks the changes when working with computer codes while GitHub is a Web-based Git version control repository hosting service. 
- It provides all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionalities of Git while topping it with a few of its own features. 
- It is a heaven for the developers where they can store their projects and get connected with like-minded people. You can think it as “cloud for codes”.

## Difference between Git and Github
- It works along with the collaboration of Git. While Git is a command line tool
- GitHub is a Web-based graphical interface which provides you with the access control, basic task management tools along with several collaboration features.
- Moreover, GitHub can host your project’s source codes in various programming languages and keep the track of the each of the changes made to every iteration.
- It provides following 3 extraordinary features which makes it so powerful:
  - fork: forking is copying a repository from one user’s account when you don’t have the write access to it. So you can just copy it and modify it under your own account.
  - pull: When you have made the changes in codes that you have copied and want to share them with its original order. Then you can send a notification called a “pull request” to them.
  - merge: Now the user who is the owner of those codes, if, finds your changes relevant can merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo, by just button click.

- If your pull request is accepted by the owner then you get its credit on the original site and shows up in your user profile. 
- So, more the people and projects on GitHub, the better idea a project maintainer gets of its potential contributors.
- This encourages the young developers and projects to grow more in the industry.
